    <p>Hello, I am Daniel Watts, I'm from Reno Nevada, and I'm majoring in Computer Science. I decided to major in computer science after I did a few classes in high school and really encjoyed the programming parts. I hope to be able to pursue a high level of education and get a job writing code. I enjoy the problem solving aspect of code and hope to be able to master a few langueges along with many other aspects of computing while here at BYUI. 
    <p> In my free time I like to read novels, play board games, and hike.
        I'm also a thesbian, and in high school, I played Repunzels prince in "Into the Woods," Doc Gibbs in "Our Town," and Sir Henry in "The Hollow. I love acting and am taking Acting 1 as an elective."
       <p> I just returned from my mission in Ogden, Utah. My favorite chapter in the scriptures is 1 John 5. I love the title Christ has of Love. I also love the message we get about charity, which we know is the greatest of all. I try to love my Savior and live so I can constantly feel his love in my life. I am excited to be here studying at a religous institution where the spirit is everywhere.
       </p>
