    <p>The Cosmere is a fictional universe created by acclaimed author Brandon Sanderson, serving as the backdrop for
      many of his epic fantasy novels. It is a vast and intricate setting where various interconnected planets exist,
      each possessing unique magic systems and distinct cultures. Despite the diversity that exists throughout the
      Cosmere, there are a few shared elements. These include the Shattering of Adonalsium, the use of intent and
      investiture, and the presence of worldhoppers.
      Adonalsium is a central and enigmatic concept within Brandon Sanderson's Cosmere universe. It is the name given to
      an all-encompassing, god-like force that existed before the Shattering. The Shattering was an event where a group
      of individuals, known as the Shards, somehow separated Adonalsium into sixteen distinct, powerful Shards, each
      representing a particular aspect or intent. These Shards were then taken up by different individuals, turning them
      into god-like beings themselves, each with their own unique magical powers and motivations. Adonalsium's
      Shattering and the subsequent distribution of its power play a pivotal role in the overarching narrative of the
      Cosmere, as characters and events are often influenced by the actions and intentions of these Shareholders.
      Adonalsium's nature and the consequences of its division remain a central mystery, adding depth and intrigue to
      the entire Cosmere lore.
      The relationship between Intent and Investiture in the Cosmere is a foundational concept that underpins the
      various magic systems in this fictional universe. Investiture is the magical power that people draw from to
      perform feats of magic. Intent represents the purpose or driving force behind the use of Investiture, and it is
      closely tied to the nature and limitations of a Shard's power. The Shards can only wield magic when they align
      their intent with the ideal they hold. Alternatively, people often have to use an amount of conceptualization to
      produce powerful magic, which is often mentally straining.
      Worldhoppers are individuals or entities in the Cosmere with the unique ability to travel between different
      planets and realms, connecting the various stories and settings within this vast fictional universe. They possess
      knowledge of the greater cosmere's cosmology and its fundamental principles, such as Investiture and the sixteen
      Shards of Adonalsium. This knowledge allows them to understand the nature of magic in different worlds.
      Worldhoppers, like the enigmatic character Hoid, often make appearances in multiple Sanderson novels, influencing
      events and adding depth to the interconnected narratives. Their presence enhances the richness and complexity of
      the Cosmere, providing readers with the joy of discovering hidden connections and Easter eggs that bind together
      the diverse range of books and series set in this imaginative universe.

    <h3>The Shards</h3>
    <p>
      Preservation: This shard is associated with the planet Scadrial and is responsible for the magic system known as
      Allomancy. It's primarily concerned with maintaining the balance and staving off Ruin.

      Ruin: Also associated with Scadrial, Ruin represents the destructive aspect of the universe. The conflict between
      Preservation and Ruin is central to the Mistborn series.

      Odium: The shard of Odium is tied to the planet Roshar and plays a central role in "The Stormlight Archive." Odium
      is known for its intense hatred and is a powerful and malevolent force in the Cosmere.

      Cultivation: Another shard on Roshar, Cultivation is associated with growth, change, and adaptation. It is often
      in opposition to Odium's destructive tendencies.

      Honor: The shard of Honor was present on Roshar, but its holder was killed, leading to its power becoming
      splintered. It left behind the remnants of the Honorblades and the Nahel bond spren.

      Devotion: This shard was present on the world of Sel, where the magic system of AonDor is practiced. Devotion's
      holder was killed, leading to its power's fragmentation.

      Dominion: Like Devotion, Dominion was also on Sel, and its holder was killed, leading to its power's
      fragmentation.

      Autonomy: Autonomy is a mysterious shard associated with the planet Taldain. It is known for its desire to control
      and influence various worlds and is a source of tension in the Cosmere.

      Endowment: The shard Endowment is found on the world of Nalthis and is responsible for the magic system of
      Awakening. It grants people the power to animate objects with their Breath.

      Ambition: Ambition was once held by a being named Uli Da, but she was killed, leading to its power becoming
      splintered. Not much is known about this shard. There is a second mention of Ambition as a shard, but it is
      unclear whether this refers to the same shard mentioned earlier or a different one.

      Whimsy: Little is known about Whimsy, except that it is a shard on the world of Threnody.

      Valor: Similar to Whimsy, little is known about Valor, except that it is a shard on the world of Threnody.

      Mercy: Mercy is another shard on Threnody and, like Whimsy and Valor, is not well-documented.

      Invention: This shard is on the planet of Patji and is associated with the events in the novella "Sixth of the
      Dusk." It's a lesser-known shard in the Cosmere.



      Wisdom: Little is known about Wisdom, except that it is a shard on the planet First of the Sun, which is featured
      in the novella "Sixth of the Dusk."

      planets.
