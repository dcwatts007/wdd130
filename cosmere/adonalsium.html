            <img id="adonalsium-hero-img" src="images/adonalsium.jpg" alt="Adonalsium">
            <p>Adonalsium is a central and enigmatic concept within Brandon Sanderson's Cosmere universe. It is the name
                given to an all-encompassing, god-like force that existed before the Shattering. The Shattering was an
                event where a group of individuals, known as the Shards, somehow separated Adonalsium into sixteen
                distinct, powerful Shards, each representing a particular aspect or intent. These Shards were then taken
                up by different individuals, turning them into god-like beings themselves, each with their own unique
                magical powers and motivations.</p>

            <h1>The Shards</h1>
            <div id="scadrial">
                <h4>
                    Scadrial
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Preservation: This shard is associated with the planet Scadrial and is responsible for the magic
                    system known as Allomancy. It's primarily concerned with maintaining the balance and staving off
                    Ruin.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ruin: Also associated with Scadrial, Ruin represents the destructive aspect of the universe. The
                    conflict between Preservation and Ruin is central to the Mistborn series.
                </p>

                    Roshar
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Odium: The shard of Odium is tied to the planet Roshar and plays a central role in "The Stormlight
                    Archive. Odium is known for its intense hatred and is a powerful and malevolent force in the
                    Cosmere."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cultivation: Another shard on Roshar, Cultivation is associated with growth, change, and adaptation.
                    It is often in opposition to Odium's destructive tendencies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Honor: The shard of Honor was present on Roshar, but its holder was killed, leading to its power
                    becoming splintered. It left behind the remnants of the Honorblades and the Nahel bond spren.
                </p>

                </h4>
                <p>
                    Devotion: This shard was present on the world of Sel, where the magic system of AonDor is practiced.
                    Devotion's holder was killed, leading to its power's fragmentation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dominion: Like Devotion, Dominion was also on Sel, and its holder was killed, leading to its power's
                    fragmentation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Autonomy: Autonomy is a mysterious shard associated with the planet Taldain. It is known for its
                    desire to control and influence various worlds and is a source of tension in the Cosmere.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Endowment: The shard Endowment is found on the world of Nalthis and is responsible for the magic

                </p>
                <p>
                    Ambition: Ambition was once held by a being named Uli Da, but she was killed, leading to its power
                    becoming splintered. Not much is known about this shard.
