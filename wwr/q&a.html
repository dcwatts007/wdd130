           While whitewater rafting has real dangers, our guides have been trained to keep you safe and will guide through the proper safety procedures before you hit any rapids. You can also choose what level of difficulty you are comfortable with. We have yet to have anyone get seriosly injured or die on our rafts, and if you listen to your guide, you won't be the first.

        <h1>
           Can I bring my kids?
        </h1>
        <p>
            Our rafting trips our great for all ages! We recomend you choose a river with only level 1 and 2 rapids for kids under the age of 12, as more difficult rapids can require the help of the rafters to avoid obstacles and can frighten younger children. However, the choice is yours. If your youngins are more adventurous, feel free to take them where ever.

            What should I bring on my rafting trip?
        </h1>
        <p>
            On your trip, you will be spending a lot of time in the sun and should expect to get wet. A lunch will be provided along the river, but any snacks you want should be packed in a waterproof bag with loops that can be secured to the raft. Additionally, you should be sure to ware sunscreen and clothes that you are fine with wearing while wet. All safety equipment will be provided.
